## Document-Classification-with-CNN
This repository is a Document Classification system using convolutional neural networks using keras. The architecture is comprised of three key pieces:

Word Embedding: A distributed representation of words where different words that have a similar meaning (based on their usage) also have a similar representation.
Convolutional Model: A feature extraction model that learns to extract salient features from documents represented using a word embedding.
Fully Connected Model: The interpretation of extracted features in terms of a predictive output.
